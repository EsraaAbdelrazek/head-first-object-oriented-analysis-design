## Rick's Problem  
Rick owns a guitar shop but struggles to efficiently match guitars to his customers’ preferences. His initial system was too **rigid**, requiring exact matches for every attribute of a guitar to find a match. This made the system:  
- **Inflexible** for partial matches.  
- **Difficult to scale** as adding new attributes required code changes throughout.  
- **Unresponsive** to dynamic customer needs.
